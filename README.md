# Project-Allocation-System

All universities and colleges are mainly focusing on making the process online with a web based application for the convenience of students and teachers.

Project Allocation System has been initiated by Eduplus Foundation in collaboration with B.R.A.C.Tâ€™s Vishwakarma Institute Of Information Technology, Pune. Project Allocation System is a web application which is used for allocating projects and monitoring their progress along with the project duration.

The process of BE project allocation was difficult, especially for Industrial projects. Before, the project coordinator had to inform the students about the new project through email and students had to generally reply to that email to show their interest in working in that industry project. And then the project coordinator then used to allocate to make a group of students and then allocate them the project. So, our team came up with the idea of developing a web application for Project Allocation System which will solve the problems faced by the Project Coordinator and students by making the process easy and on a single platform.

Our web application consists of different dashboards for students, faculties and coordinators. Students will be able to create a group/ join a group. Coordinators will be able to add new projects to the web application and then students can check the details of the project and if interested can apply to the project in a group. After which the coordinator can see the applications and finally assign the project to one of the student groups and faculty mentor to them.

The programming languages used in this project are Handlebars.js for frontend and Node.js for the backend. Various modules of node.js like npm, Axios, Express, and modules of Handlebars.js like bootstrap have been used. For database, MySQL is used. Also, Xampp is used to set up servers and phpmyadmin to handle the data. The project allocation system can be deployed on the servers of various colleges.
